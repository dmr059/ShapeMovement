## Shape Movement
This is a simple interative demo build with SFML 2.5.1 that showcases two moving rectangles on screen. One rectangle moves automatically, while the other is controlled by the player.

The project demonstrates:

- Basic shape rendering
- Keyboard input handling
- Screen Wrapping
- Collision detection
- Color changes on collision

## How to Run:
### Prerequisites ---

- C++ compiler
- SFML 2.5.1 installed

### Controls - For Green Rectangle ---

- W --> moves you Up
- S --> moves you Down
- A --> moves you Left
- D --> moves you right

   > The Red Rectangle moves on its own - continuously drifting down and slightly to the right.

## Goals from here:
This was a fun project that introduced me to SFML, and I really enjoyed building it! There's so much potential to expand and experiment with different ideas. I'm looking forward to diving deeper.

Next, I'd like to:

- Work with sprites
- Introduce basic physics or animation
- Create more & different interactions between objects
  
Feel free to fork, explore, and build on it! Happy coding!
