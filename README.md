# Shape Movement
This is an interative demo build with SFML 2.5.1 that showcases two moving rectangles on screen. One rectangle moves automatically, while the other is controlled by the player.

## Features

- Basic shape rendering
- Keyboard input handling
- Screen Wrapping
- Collision detection
- Color changes on collision

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- SFML 2.5.1 installed

### Controls - For Green Rectangle ---

- W --> moves you Up
- S --> moves you Down
- A --> moves you Left
- D --> moves you right

   > The Red Rectangle moves on its own - continuously drifting down and slightly to the right.

## Development Notes and Goals
This was a fun first dive into SFML, and I really enjoyed building it! It helped me learn the basics of rendering, input, and collision logic. There's a lot of potential for expanding on this foundation and I am looking forward to building more involved games. 

Next Steps:

- Work with sprites
- Introduce basic physics or animation
- Create more & different interactions between objects
  
Feel free to fork, explore, and build on it! Happy coding!
